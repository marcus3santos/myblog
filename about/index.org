My career is deeply rooted in Computer Engineering. I was born and raised in Brazil, and obtained my Phd in Artificial Intelligence at the Universidade de São Paulo.

Since 1999, I have taught Computer Science to thousands of students at Ryerson. My prime interest is Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Programming.

In 2014, I was appointed Associate Dean, Undergraduate Programs and Student Affairs – a role that combines my passion for both the academic and human sides of education.
